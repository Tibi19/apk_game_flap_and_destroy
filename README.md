# Flap And Destroy
An innovative take on the "flappy bird" trend on android.
The game follows Earl, a hungry pigeon fighting for food and territory in New York City.

Combines movement mechanics of Flappy Bird and the environment interaction of Mario. The more enemies you take down, the more points you make.
The game also becomes harder as there will be more enemies and more diverse!
